<p class="p1">Hello, My name is Wendy Si. I am from Shanghai, but was born and raised in Melbourne. My date of birth is the 8th of February 2003 and my background is Chinese. I graduated from Nossal High School in 2020 and am now a first year Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I can speak English and Mandarin Chinese, and can understand Shanghainese. A fun fact about me is that I used to be a state level swimmer when I was around 10 years old. My hobbies are playing video games, reading manga, watching anime and going out with friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">My interest in Information Technology is mainly centred around the coding aspect, I am interested in creating programs and learning the languages. I like how Information Technology is very practical as well, with getting the opportunity to make things. This allows me to implement what I’ve learnt and be able to create projects and sharpen my skills. Information Technology is a forever changing industry, with new advances in technology coming about each and every day, and that is something I want to be a part of. It also has a wide variety of career options which would help with my indecisiveness. My interest in Information Technology started in 2017, when I had digital technology as one of my electives, I would then go on to choose it again the following year and participated at an internship at TATA Consultancies. I am also interested in Information Technology as there are a lot of career opportunities in the Information Technology field and technology is the future and therefore Information Technology will be future proof.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the people that inspired me to do Information Technology was my old digital technology teacher at school. He was one of my favourite teachers and made the class very engaging and fun. This made me more interested in the subject and therefore I aimed to do well. There hasn’t been a particular event that sparked my interest, but the time I spent at TATA learning about women in the Information Technology field did encourage me to pursue this area of study. My experience in Information Technology is very minimal. I learnt enough HTML to build a website back in 2017 and completed an online course in Python 2 in 2018, however those skills are long forgotten as I haven’t retained my knowledge from that time. I still have fond memories regarding learning about Information Technology such as HTML, therefore it encouraged me to apply for this university course.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">I chose to come to RMIT as I recently moved near to the city, so the location is near my house. RMIT also has a high ranking in the Information Technology sector, and have a good reputation in Bachelor of Information Technology. RMIT also has many industry connections which would be beneficial for post grad job opportunities. Another reason why I wanted to come here was because I went on a school trip to RMIT in 2018 and was impressed by the facilities and campus.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">I expect to learn more about programming languages, and develop an understanding of information systems. I am also expecting to apply my knowledge in a practical manner. I would also like to learn more about softwares and databases such as building softwares and using databases and also how to become a value part of companies and businesses through being able to support them reach their goals and allow them to work more efficiently.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The position is for a Cyber Security Analyst, where the role is to research and evaluate cyber security threats and conduct assessments into the level of protection infrastructures have. The role involves detecting and reporting on threats and resolving them. The position is appealing to me as it involves finding vulnerabilities in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>networks and systems and in turn, repairing them. Why this is appealing to me is that now more than ever, cyber security is a crucial part of companies and being able to protect the infrastructure and also protect consumers and users from data breaches.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The skills required for the position are technical knowledge of mainstream operating systems and security technologies, written and verbal communication skills, being able to play an active part in a team and having an open mind and approaching situations collaboratively. The qualifications required for the position are technical expertise in system security vulnerabilities and remediation techniques. The experience required for the position is experience in security incident analysis and response.</p>
<p class="p1">The skills, qualifications and experience I currently have is written and verbal communication skills, being able to play an active part in a team and having an open mind and approaching situations collaboratively. How I will go about obtaining the skills required that I do not have is through researching the specifics of the skills they require and starting to build on my own knowledge throughout the course and also through my own studying. I will try to get experience through internships and post grad career opportunities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">I still possess the same opinion about my ideal job, However throughout the progress of the course I have learnt that there is a much broader range of jobs in i.t than what I first envisioned. I still believe that a career in cyber security is still something I am interested in and there are multiple job opportunities available. Jobs in cyber security require a high understanding of operating systems and languages such as C, C++, Python, JavaScript and Assembly which are skills that I have not yet acquired. According to the burning glass data, demand in cyber security is increasing every year, whilst the supply is staying the same. This would mean that a career in the cyber security field would be relatively easier to find compared to other fields. I am interested in this field as analysing situations and problem solving are something I have always enjoyed and cyber security requires quite a bit of that.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span>My test outcome for the 16personalities test was ISFP. ISFP people tend to have introverted, observant, feeling and prospecting personality traits. These results may influence my behaviour in a team negatively as ISFP personalities want to do things their own way and being in a team would restrict that. By taking these into account and according to 16personalities, when forming a team I should have a balance of set goals and also freedom to express myself as well as dealing with problems one-on-one or by myself. According to educationplanner.org, I am a 50% visual learner, 45% auditory learner, and 5% tactile learner. Visual learner means that you learn by reading or seeing pictures and understand through sight. These results may impact my behaviour in a team negatively as visual learners may have difficulty with spoken instructions which are often presented in group settings through discussions and interactions. Behaviours of visual learners that could benefit a team is having a strong imagination and understanding projects as a whole. By taking these traits of visual learners into account when forming a team, I should aim to try and write down instructions I get so that I am able to review and understand them at a later date, and also contributing my ideas before the opportunity passes. The results from truity.com show that I scored high in neuroticism and low in conscientiousness. Those scoring high in neuroticism typically react to situations negatively, or think about situations in a pessimistic manner. Those with low conscientiousness scores are often more impulsive and easily distracted. Going by these results, my behaviour would impact my team negatively, as I would not stay on top of tasks and deadlines, and also give up easily when plans go astray. By taking these results into account, a way to combat these negative traits would be to actively try to overcome them by recognising when the behaviours are being exhibited and correcting them.</p>
<p class="p1">I wanted to create an application that would be simplistic in nature. The project idea that I came up with is a mobile application that lets people make cocktails, mixed drinks, mocktails etc. in the comfort of their own home. The application allows you to put in drink preferences, what beverages the user has access to, and from there provides the what beverages the user is able to make with what they have on hand, the recipes for said beverages and also what they would be able to make with if they had a few more ingredients.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">I wanted to choose this for my project as I am someone who enjoys a good cocktail or beverage, and through personal experience, I don’t really know what drinks I can make with what I have available currently, so that’s why I wanted to create an application that would be able to show users what’s available at their fingertips. Statistics from </span>the National Health Survey also found that in 2017–18 among Australians aged 18 and over, 79% had consumed alcohol in the past year, so an application that would allow users to make cocktails with what’s available at home would be something desirable, especially during the current pandemic and lockdowns, where many people are unable to access a good cocktail, mocktail or mixed drink.</p>
<p class="p5">Now I’m going to be going into more specifics about the features of the application. The application would be quite bare-boned, hopefully having a minimalistic and clean feel to it. Users are able to create accounts on the application if they would want to save recipes and/or want to have available ingredients automatically inserted each time they open the application. If not, the application would be able to accessed through a guest mode, just for ease of access for those that do not want to go through a sign up process or create an account. Once the application is accessed, it should be easy to locate what the users are looking for, with a bottom or top bar showing settings, account, ingredients, recipes and saved recipes. A feature that the application would have that I believe would be very helpful is a section where history of viewed recipes would be accessible, as often, many people look at something and forget to save it for later, causing inconvenience. In the settings, users are able to change app features such as to hide alcoholic recipes if for underage users and other settings to enhance user experience like notifications, a help centre, themes and whether the user would prefer imperial or metric measurements. In the account tab, users are able to add friends and/or follow people to see what beverages other people are making and perhaps take inspiration. To create an account they can connect via third parties such as Facebook and Google, among other parties. Users are also able to rate recipes they have previously created which would show on profile and would be able to be public or private depending on user settings. The ingredients tab would allow for users to insert what ingredients they have readily available at home from a drop down menu depending on alcohol (if applicable), mixers, and further ingredients. If something is not available, users are able to input an ‘Other: ‘ option where the system would search for that ingredient via name. In the recipes tab, there filter selector, where users are able to select whether they would want a mild, medium, or strong alcohol beverage, if they want to show recipes where the user would have all but a few ingredients and what type of beverage they would like. The recipes tab would then show the users what recipes are available to them, with pictures, main ingredients and ratings from other users. If no beverages are able to be made with what the user has available then beverages that are able to be made with a few more ingredients are shown. Saved recipes tab would show all the recipes the user has saved for later, the tab also would have a feature where the user is able to group and filter the beverages they have saved, having the ability to create folders for beverages. The overall service of the application would be easily accessible without flashy features to confuse the user.</p>
<p class="p5">To create the application, multiple tools and softwares would be required. Something that I think I would need would be Figma. Figma allows for me to create a prototype for the application so I am able to see how the application is and so I can further enhance user experience. As I do not have a lot of knowledge around app development, I accessed <span class="s2">https://www.techradar.com/au/best/best-mobile-app-development-software</span> to try and find more information about what softwares would be the best for application development. The one that has been rated highest was Appy Pie, which is a no-coding app development platform. As the interface is very simplistic and easy to manoeuvre, I feel like it would be a good software to start with to create the application.</p>
<p class="p5">The skills required for this role would be knowledge around coding to find and correct errors around the development of the application. In regards to software, after doing some research, Appy Pie seems like a very safe option, although my using that, I am not able to fully customise the application to my desire, as with creating platforms, they often have a range of selections that they have available to you, with not much out of that. If I were to use the Appy Pie software, then realistically there wouldn’t be much skills required.</p>
<p class="p5">If my project were to be successful, the outcome would not be impacting society, however might help people with boredom and be able to save them money. The original problem of users not knowing what they are able to make with what they have in front of them would be solved, perhaps enhancing user’s time at home.</p>
